# Important things to be Implimented before Demo (to complete requirements describe in syllabus)
- [ ] Finish the wishlist button
  - Have it add the product to the current users wishlist list.
  - Hopefully do this without redirecting to a different page
- [ ] Bundle Searching
  - Create a drop down in the home page that allows any user to search for bundles
  - Probably, copy the first drop down, which querys the database for products, and passes that as a choice list to the drop down form.
  - And then return a template that displays all of the bundles that have that given item contained in them
- [ ] *Advanced* Product / Service Searching
  - Search for a product based on multiple axes
  - This one is a pain. I dont know any easy way to impliment it.
  - Most likely, we will have to hard code each different axis, with a axis and a single value
  - Examples would be
    - Price, Lower Bound
    - Price, Upper Bound
    - Delivery Time, Less than a wekk (this would require us modifying the actual product model since its not in there currently) 
- Theres more things that could be implimented, like making the products / serivces / bundles look better on the page, and improving the bundle searching, but this is what we need to maximize our grades
